# demo of EPI phase error along phase direction
Root cause of EPI phase error among even and odd echos along phase encoding direction is mainly induced by gradient 'cross term' when scanning oblique plane. 
The gradient 'cross term' will induce delay between X and Y physics axises, thus linear phase error along PE direction will occur. 
And linear phase along phase direction will induce Nyquist Ghost(y linear term)
